                  <h1> What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>

                  <p><strong> Lorem Ipsum</strong> is a simply dummy text of the printing and typesentting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the<br>
industry's standard dummy text ever since the 100s, when an unknoen printer took a galley of type and<br>
scrambled it to make aspecimen book. ti has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into<br>
eelectronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.it was popularised in the 1960s with the relese of<br>
Letrasetsheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like<br>
<strong><em><u>Aldus PageMarker</u></em></strong> including versions of <u>Lorem Ipsum</u> 1914 translation by H. Rackham

                  <blockquote> But I must explain toyou how all this mistaken idea of denouncing plesure and praising pain was<br>
                   born and I will gibe you a complete accountof the system, and expound the actual teachings of the teachingsof the<br>
                   great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,<br>
                   because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are<br>
                   extremely painful. Nor againis there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itseelf, because it is pain. but<br>
                   because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can precus him some great pleasue.</blockquote>

                   <h2><strong> Why do we use it?</strong></h2>
                   <p>it is alongestablished factthat a reader wil be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its<br>
layout. The point of using <u>Lorem Ipsum</u> is that is has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to<br>
using "Countenthere, content here", making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and<br>
web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their defult model text, and a search for "lorem Ipsum" will uncover<br>
many web sites still in their infancy. Various verious versionshave evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,<br>
sometimes on purpose (injuctedhumour and the like).</p>
                    
                
<h3><strong> Where can I get some?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Thereare many variationsof passages</strong> of Lorem Ipsum availale, but the majority have suffered<br>
alteration in some form, but injected humour, or <u>radomized words</u> which don't look even slightly<br> 
believable. if you are going to use a passage of LoremIpsum, you need to be sure there is't anything<br>
embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. <em> All the Lorem Ipsumgenerators on the internet tend to repeat<br>
predefinedchunks as nesessary, making this the first true generator on the internet.</em>it uses a dictionary of over<br>
200 Litin words, combined with adandful of model sentence structrures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks<br>
reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetion, injected humour, or non-<br>
characteristic words etc.
